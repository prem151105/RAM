# AgentNet Framework Architecture

## Overview

The AgentNet Customer Support System is built on a multi-agent architecture where each agent specializes in handling specific types of customer support tasks. The system consists of several key components that work together to provide efficient and effective customer support.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent System

The agent system is the heart of the framework, consisting of:

- **Router**: Decides how to handle incoming tasks (forward, split, or execute)
- **Executor**: Processes tasks using LLM and task-specific prompts
- **Memory**: Stores and retrieves past experiences using RAG
- **Weight Manager**: Updates connection weights between agents

### 2. Network System

The network system manages the flow of tasks between agents:

- **Network Manager**: Handles agent connections and task routing
- **Weight Updater**: Adjusts connection weights based on performance
- **Task Distributor**: Ensures balanced workload across agents

### 3. Task Processing System

The task processing system handles the lifecycle of support tasks:

- **Task Definition**: Specifies task types and requirements
- **Task Processor**: Manages task execution and monitoring
- **Result Aggregator**: Combines results from multiple agents

## Data Flow

1. **Input**: Customer support tickets and conversations
2. **Processing**:
   - Task routing through the agent network
   - Parallel processing by specialized agents
   - Memory-based experience retrieval
3. **Output**: Resolution recommendations and time estimates

## Memory System

The memory system uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to:

- Store past resolutions and experiences
- Retrieve relevant information for new tasks
- Update knowledge base with new solutions

## Configuration

The system is configured through YAML files:

- `agent_config.yaml`: Agent-specific settings
- `network_config.yaml`: Network topology and parameters
- `task_config.yaml`: Task processing parameters

## Performance Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive monitoring:

- Task completion rates
- Resolution accuracy
- Processing time
- Agent utilization
- Memory hit rates
