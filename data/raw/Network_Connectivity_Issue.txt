Customer: "Hello, I can't connect to my smart home devices anymore through your app. It was working fine yesterday, but now it says 'No devices found on local network.' I've tried restarting my phone."
Agent: "Hi! Thanks for contacting us. Let's check the app's network permissions. Go to Settings > Apps > [App Name] > Permissions. Is 'Local Network' enabled?"
Customer: "Oh, it's set to 'Ask every time' but I haven't seen any prompts. Should I change it to 'Always allow'?"
Agent: "No worries! Please clear the app cache: Settings > Storage > Clear Cache. Then log in again. Does that help?"
Customer: "That fixed it! Devices are showing up now. Strange that it suddenly stopped working though."
Agent: "Glad to hear it! A recent update may have reset permissions. We'll flag this to our dev team. Cheers!"
